## [Halfpipe](https://halfpipe.sh)

Halfpipe is a command-line utility for streaming data to and from:

1. Snowflake
1. Oracle
1. SQL Server
1. S3 Buckets
1. ODBC connections (bring your own database drivers)
1. Postgres support is on the roadmap next

It reduces the complexity of common data integration patterns to single commands that run the same on your workstations as they do in production. 

Among other things it supports:

* Extracting snapshots periodically
* Extracting deltas periodically
* Oracle Continuous Query Notifications to stream in real-time
* HTTP service to start/stop/launch jobs
* Automatic conversion of table metadata DDL
* [AWS Lambda](#12-factor-mode---support-for-serverless-with-aws-lambda) (for simple productionisation)

Halfpipe is a DataOps utility for streaming data. It's designed to be light-weight and easy to use.
Use command-line switches for pre-canned actions or write your own pipes in YAML or JSON to sync
data in near real-time. Start an HTTP server to expose functionality via a RESTful API.
Half-Pipe is not yet cluster-aware but it scales out. Start multiple instances of this tool and
off you go. Happy munging! ðŸ˜„

## Usage / Deployment

Halfpipe is a light-weight Golang binary compiled against Oracle Database 19.5 Instant Client drivers (it's backwards compatible with older Oracle versions too). 

Choose *__one__* of these options to get going:

#### A) Quick Start - Docker Image With Oracle Client Included

Use the [Quick Start](#quick-start) instructions below to build a local Docker image that contains the Halfpipe CLI and the Oracle client drivers. This is the easy option that drops you into a command prompt ready to use the `hp` tool or the [`configure.sh`](demo-svg/configure/README.md) script.

#### B) Bring You Own Client

Download one of the Release binaries and add it to your target environment. Copy the plugins to `/usr/local/lib` to get started. If you don't want Oracle or ODBC functionality you should be good to just use the `hp` standalone binary. If you want Oracle functionality via the Oracle plugin, you'll need the Oracle Instant Client installed and on your PATH.  If you get an error like `hp: error while loading shared libraries: libclntsh.so.19.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory` ensure your ORACLE_HOME environment variable is set and the OCI library is accessible.  If you follow Oracle's Instant Client set-up instructions and check that SQL*Plus works, you should be good to go. The ODBC plugin requires unixODBC libraries. Run the `configure.sh` script to learn how to set up basic connections.

## Quick Start

The following steps will walk through option A above to:-

1. build a local Docker image containing Halfpipe and Oracle client drivers
1. add connections for an Oracle database, Snowflake and S3
1. create a Snowflake external stage compatible with Halfpipe
1. set default flag values for the `hp` CLI

After this, you'll be ready to use the example commands shown [below](#sample-commands) or in the [tl;dr section](#tldr-features--demos) above. 

Good luck and drop me an [email](#want-to-know-more-or-have-a-feature-request) if you run into any issues. Happy munging! ðŸ˜„  

### Prerequisites

1. Docker
1. An S3 bucket to be used as an external Snowflake stage
1. A valid profile entry in AWS CLI file `~/.aws/credentials` (by default this needs to be called `halfpipe` - notes on how to override it are below) that can read/write the S3 bucket above
1. Oracle database connection details
1. Snowflake database connection details (please see the [`configure.sh`](demo-svg/configure/README.md) documentation to learn more if you're not using Snowflake)  

### Steps

```bash
# Build and start the Halfpipe Docker image with default AWS_PROFILE=halfpipe...

./start-halfpipe.sh

# Once you're inside the Docker image, log in using a valid auth key like the 
# one shown here:

hp user login aiHbKdA0lZIs3a2VCWySQyixfgTDxhRMlHNZ7bDGkes33.t8LTnzd38.anwJ1nc

# Run this script to create connections and set default flag values.
# Follow the prompts and you're good to go:

./configure.sh -c
```

* `start-halfpipe.sh` builds and starts a Docker image that contains the Halfpipe CLI and Oracle drivers. 
  By default it uses an `AWS_PROFILE` called "halfpipe" to supply IAM credentials.
  Use `-h` to see usage and the `-a` flag to override this.
* The `hp user login` command above is valid for a user called `tester1@halfpipe.sh`. It has privileges required
  to configure Halfpipe and execute core actions like `cp meta`, `cp snap` and `query`. 
  If you'd like to take more features for a spin, please reach out to me using my [email](#want-to-know-more-or-have-a-feature-request) below.
  See also the [Notes](#notes) below for some security considerations.
* `configure.sh -c` requests user input and runs basic set-up to create connections to Oracle, Snowflake and S3. 
  Here's an example [transcript](./demo-svg/configure/README.md). See the help output of [`configure.sh -h`](./demo-svg/configure/README.md#usage-of-configuresh) 
  to learn more about the `hp` commands required to create connections and set default flag values.  


## Sample Commands

Once you have connections setup, it's as simple as a single command to copy data snapshots or deltas between databases. 

Here are a few sample actions - the demos above cover them all in more detail.

Alternatively head over to https://halfpipe.sh/in-detail/#learn to see a set of short videos that explain some of the features. 

```bash
# copy a snapshot of all data from Oracle table DIM_TIME to Snowflake via S3...
hp cp snap oracle.dim_time snowflake.dim_time

# copy a snapshot of all data from Oracle table DIM_TIME to a S3 bucket connection...
hp cp snap oracle.dim_time demo-data-lake

# copy changes to Snowflake found in Oracle table DIM_TIME since the last time we looked
# repeat every hour...
# (SK_DATE is both the primary key and column that drives changes)
hp cp delta oracle.dim_time snowflake.dim_time -p sk_date -d sk_date -i 3600

# above we used a target connection called demo-data-lake for a S3 bucket - here's how to add it...
# more example of adding connections are in the Setup section below
hp config connections add s3 -c demo-data-lake -d s3://test.s3.reeslloyd.com

# copy a snapshot of all data from database OracleA, table DIM_TIME, to another Oracle database...
hp cp snap oracle.dim_time my-ora-connection.my_dim_time

# create a Snowflake STAGE called MYSTAGE to load data from S3 
# use -h for help or append -e to execute DDL...
hp create stage snowflake -s MYSTAGE

# synchronise all rows in source to target (make target data the same as source)...
hp sync batch oracle.dim_time snowflake.dim_time

# stream data from DIM_TIME to Snowflake in real-time... 
hp sync events oracle.dim_time snowflake.dim_time

# run a web service and listen for pipe actions in JSON/YAML...
# see the demos animations above for examples
hp serve 

# configure default flag values to save time having to supply them on the CLI...
hp config defaults -h

# configure database connections...
hp config connections -h

# explore the demos above to see how you can add other connection types...
# or perform more simple actions to move data quickly.
```

## 12 Factor Mode - Support for Serverless With AWS Lambda

Halfpipe is small enough to run in AWS Lambda. 

You can use the main Halfpipe binary `hp` (zipped ~7MB) on its own when connecting between Snowflake, SQL Server and S3, 
but, if you require Oracle or ODBC connectivity, you'll need to publish a Lambda layer with the Halfpipe plugins 
(see release binaries) and database drivers (e.g. Oracle OCI).

To get started, you essentially need to create a Lambda with environment variables that mimic existing CLI arguments and flags.

For instructions and sample environment variables, take a look at [this blog](https://halfpipe.sh/blog/07-running-halfpipe-in-aws-lambda/).  


## Notes

The following files are AES-256 encrypted and base64 encoded at rest:

* Default flag values are picked up from file `~/.halfpipe/config.yml`
* Database connections are stored in file `~/.halfpipe/connections.yaml` 

Use the `config` CLI command to configure them.

When a user session is started by running command `hp user login <auth-key>`, anyone with access to the CLI can essentially 
use the database connections. Use `hp user logout` to end the session. 

See usage by running `hp user login -h` and the `-d` flag to configure session duration. Default duration is 1 day.


## Limitations

* `hp sync events` does not work inside the Docker container fired up by `start-halfpipe.sh`... 
The issue is that Oracle expects to be able to notify the HalfPipe (`hp`) process using an 
open port. While the process appears to work and performs an initial table sync, 
it silently never receives further notifications events. 
Work around this when running the container on Linux by using host networking.
Alternatively, take the `hp` binary out of the container and use matching Oracle drivers directly
on a Linux host. 
* `hp sync events` will stream DML changes from source to target, but where >=100 rows
are committed per source transaction, it generates a full table re-sync as per the `hp sync batch`
command. This requires Oracle priv `GRANT CHANGE NOTIFICATION TO <user>` to work.
* `hp cp meta` doesn't produce ALTER TABLE statements yet. Drop the target table and recreate to 
work around this.
